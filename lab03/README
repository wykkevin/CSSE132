Go into the clmystery directory and read the file called "instructions" using
the "cat" command.  It will tell you what to do.

The instructions file says how to find the answer or check your answer using a
"solutions" file.  Don't be tempted! You won't be graded on whether or not you
solved the murder, but rather _how_ you solved it.


TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER:
---------------------

Copy and paste the following command, replace John Doe with the suspect's name
you want to check, and execute it _from inside the main clmystery directory_:

  echo "John Doe" | $(command -v md5 || command -v md5sum) \
  | grep -qif /dev/stdin encoded && echo CORRECT\! GREAT WORK, GUMSHOE. \
  || echo SORRY, TRY AGAIN.
