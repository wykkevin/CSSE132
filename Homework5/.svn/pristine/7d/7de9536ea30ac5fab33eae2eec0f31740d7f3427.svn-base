/**
 * This function returns the greater of two arguments.
 * 
 * You will need to do a comparison for this.  Remember that 
 * cmp sets all the CSPR registers (EQ, ZERO, etc) and the next
 * instruction can use them. (BEQ, BLE, etc).
 * HINT: to copy the value of a register into another, use the "mov"
 * instruction:
 *   mov r0, r1 ; copies value of r1 into r0
 * 
 * @param r0: first arg, x
 * @param r1: second arg, y
 * @returns the greater value of x or y

/**
 * This function sums an array.
 *
 * You'll need a loop for this, and will probably want to
 * use a few registers as temporary storage.
 *
 * Some hints:
 *  * to multiply the value in a register by 2, shift it left one bit.
 *    This instruction shifts a r4's value left one bit and stores the
 *    result in r3:
 *     lsl r3, r4, #1
 *
 *  * in ARM, things in [ ] are treated as a memory address. For
 *    example, the following instruction loads the value in memory at
 *    the address contained in r4 plus 2 (r3 = Mem[r4+2]):
 *     ldr r3, [r4, #2]
 *
 *  * There are many ways to do this (hard) problem.  If you want to
 *    try and use fewer instructions, look up ARMv7 addressing modes
 *    or ask your instructor for tips.
 * 
 * @param r0: the base address of the array (pointer)
 * @param r1: the number of elements in the array
 * @returns the sum of the elements in the array
